# Part 1 - Dlyan's Analysis
# Code changes are available for Part 1 in pj1_team11.ipynb between the comments - # Test the number of countries in dataset and # Alcohol Consumption vs Life Expectancy

# Analysis: 1 Country Summary

## Life Expectancy
Highest Life Expectancy for a country between 2000 - 2015 was Austria with the average age of 80.6870
Lowest Life Expectancy  for a country between 2000 - 2015 was Burundi with the average age of 65.90665.

## Adult Mortality
Highest Adult Mortality for a country between 2000 - 2015 was Lebanon with the average rate of 72 %
Lowest Adult Mortality  for a country between 2000 - 2015 was Norway with the average rate of  68 %

## Gender Comparison
Found that no significant difference is seen between the global average life expectancy age and adult mortality rate between men and women between 2000 - 2015  

## BMI and Alcohol Consumption Comparison 
Scatter plot indicates a strong relationship between alcohol consumption within a nation and the nations average BMI. This indicates that alcohol plays a factor in weight gain for a nation or at leasts shows resource disparities, as those with no alcohol consumptions crowd the bottom of the BMIâ€™s for nations.

# Analysis: 2a Yearly Summary

## Global change for Population, GDP, and Total Expenditure
The data showed a similar trend which is an increase in population, GDP, and total expenditure

## Population vs. GDP
The output showed a strong positive correlation between Population and GDP (r-value = 0.75, r-squared = 0.57)
The larger the population, the higher the GDP; 0.57 suggests that a significant proportion of the variability in GDP can be accounted for by population

## Population vs. Total Expenditure
The output showed a mild positive correlation between Population and Total Expenditure (r-value = 0.47, r-squared = 0.22)
The data showed that Population  may affect Total expenditure ; 0.22 suggests that 22% of the variability in Total Expenditure can be accounted for by Population

## GDP VS. Total Expenditure
The output showed a mild positive correlation between GDP and Total Expenditure (r-value = 0.46, r-squared = 0.21)
The data showed that GDP  may affect Total expenditure ; 0.21 suggests that 21% of the variability in Total Expenditure can be accounted for by GDP
# 2b. Melissa's Analysis Groupby Year
# Life Expectancy:
- The average life expectancy of men across the world from 2000-2015 was approximately 67-69 years 
- The average life expectancy of women across the world from 2000-2015 was approximately 67-68 years 
-While the combined average life expectancy from 2000-2015 was approximately 67
# GDP Per Capita:
- The p-value for GDP per capita vs. The combined average life expectancy was 0.92
- This means that the economic development of a country does not directly affect life expectancy
Just because a country might have more economic growth does not mean the population will live longer and vice versa
